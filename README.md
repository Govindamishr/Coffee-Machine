This code represents a coffee machine simulator implemented in Java. It consists of three classes: `Coffee`, `CoffeeMachine`, and `Main`. 

The `Coffee` class defines different types of coffees and their properties, such as the type, price, water quantity, milk quantity, and bean quantity. 

The `CoffeeMachine` class represents the coffee machine itself. It has methods for filling ingredients, making coffee, taking money, and displaying ingredient levels and analytics. The coffee machine keeps track of the amount of water, milk, beans, money earned, and the counts of each type of coffee made.

The `Main` class serves as the entry point for the program. It creates instances of the `CoffeeMachine` and `Scanner` classes. It also defines three types of coffees: espresso, latte, and cappuccino. The main method presents a menu to the user, allowing them to interact with the coffee machine by choosing options such as buying a coffee, filling ingredients, taking money, and viewing ingredient levels and analytics.

Overall, this code provides a basic simulation of a coffee machine, allowing users to interact with it and perform various operations.
